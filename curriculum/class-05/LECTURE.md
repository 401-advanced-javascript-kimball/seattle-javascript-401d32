## Mongo and NoSQL

SQL vs NoSQL
- Pros and Con of these two database type
    - SQL is relational: connects table with other tables
    - One universal language that all tables /  dbs share.
    - But it can be restrictive when we need things to change.
        - It required predetermined tables, and fields.
        - This lets us powerful like JOINs.
        
    - NoSQL does not have a universal language, but is more dynamic.
        - We can alter values and add properties to `collections` much more easily.
        - We have to be careful about corrupting previous values.
        
        
  Mongo
  - Our NoSQL flavor:  
    Mongoose: ORM (Object Relational Mapping);
